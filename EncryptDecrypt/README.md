# XOR Encrypt / Decrypt Example

* XOR is common method used by Malwares to hide data, this method consider weak and easy to detect.
* Some Malwares uses more advanced methods such as custom RC4, real encryption algorithms, etc.
* I decided to create example project demonstrating the usage of XOR operation for Encrypt / Decrypt a given file.
* Latter this method is used in my POC Malware.
